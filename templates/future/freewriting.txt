You need to add your new directory to the environment variable PYTHONPATH, separated by a colon from previous contents thereof. In any form of Unix, you can do that in a startup script appropriate to whatever shell you're using (.profile or whatever, depending on your favorite shell) with a command which, again, depends on the shell in question; in Windows, you can do it through the system GUI for the purpose.

superuser.com may be a better place to ask further, i.e. for more details if you need specifics about how to enrich an environment variable in your chosen platform and shell, since it's not really a programming question per se.

There are some books I keep coming back to when I am "feeling lost and/or hopeless", when my "back is up against the wall and/or feel cornered", when I feel like I have "hit rock bottom" or I just need to "escape reality"... This list contains books I have read/listened to more than a couple times:
!For inspiration:! 1. Loosing my virginity (Richard Branson) - Richard Branson's Autobiography. From student magazine to Virgin to crazy ballooning adventures and space! I keep coming back to this when I feel like I need a morale boost. There isn't an audible version for this book, but there is a summary-type version on Audible "Screw it, Let's do it"- does a good job curating the exciting parts.
  2. The Everything Store (Brad Stone)
-AMAZON and the man leading the massive team behind it. Jeff Bezos is quite easily one of the most important and influential people in the world. His relentless pursuit to build Amazon (& it's various products) amid constant setbacks, losses and naysayers... I personally use Amazon and their products every day. It's a really interesting view of how things are run backstage.
  3. Steve Jobs (Walter Isaacson)
- One of the most popular books in the Valley. Almost all startup founders I have met has read this. They usually have a very polarized view of Jobs after reading this. Take the good stuff and leave out the bad/crazy. Jobs was a very polarizing person and so is his biography...This is a very long book. "The second Coming of Steve Jobs" by Alan Deutschman is another really good book and a much shorter read and not super-polarizing (leaves out some of the crazy stuff from early life). Other notable Steve Jobs books I have read & highly recommend: Becoming Steve Jobs & The Steve Jobs Way.
  4. Elon Musk (Ashlee Vance)
-Another polarizing book. I am a Spacex & Tesla Fan-boy. I picked this up in 2015 the day it was launched! I have read this at least half a dozen times by now. Hard-work, perseverance and creativity to the max. A must read for every entrepreneur.
  5. iWoz (Steve Wozniak)
-If you are a technical-founder, this is a must read! Gives a very interesting view of- behind the scenes at Apple during its inception and early years. I was really moved by how humble Woz was/is and I am inspired by his problem solving approach.
  6. How Google Works (Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle & Jonathan Rosenberg)
- A very good book to read after/before this: "In the Plex" by Steven Levy. Hands down the two most important / influential books while you are starting something new. I read these while I was contemplating conceiving my startup and giving up the "safety" (illusion of safety) of a "normal-job". A must read for anyone planing to start a company and want to take it to the stratosphere (or higher)!
  7. Dreams from My Father (Barack Obama)
- Another polarizing personality. A short but powerful memoir by Obama. This gives a unique insight into Obama's thought processes. Most people can relate to this and every "Leader" must read this. It really helps clear some of the fog on- what makes an effective leader.
!Business & Management:!
  1. The Upstarts (Brad Stone)
-An amazing story about AirBnB and Uber. Culture is key and culture is defined by the Founders and the first few hires. The two companies are extremely similar in many ways (timing, shared economy, disruptive) but radically different in the way they are run. This came out earlier this year and is probably one of the best "startup-books" of 2017!
  2. Zero to One (Peter Thiel)
-A very short book, a must read for every entrepreneur. Dives into "first principal" thinking & execution. A very good read after/before "Elon Musk" the biography by Ashlee Vance.
  3. The power of Habit (Charles Duhigg)
-I have always wondered how successful people get so much done. They have the same amount of time as everyone else, but they are able to get so much more done...how? This book answered that question. Ever since, I have been using "Habits" as my ultimate personal tool. Day & night difference when you figure out how habits are formed how they are broken and how you can influence the process. A good companion book (from the same author) "Smarter Faster Better".
  4. How to win friends & Influence people (Dale Carnegi)
- I bought this book freshman year in college. I tried reading it then and gave up / got bored after the first few pages. I really wish I had actually made an effort to read the whole thing. It sat on my shelf collecting dust. Luckily I picked up the book again and gave it another shot. I read this during a particularly "rough-patch" at our startup- really helped me cope with the "situation". What was once a boring book is now scribbled with notes, bookmarks and highlights. A very useful life-guide.
  5. How to win at the Sport of Business (Mark Cuban)
- A very entertaining yet eye-opening book. It is very short, finished it in a couple hours. A must read for every entrepreneur. I keep coming back to this when I feel like things are going dreadfully slow and I need a boost. If you follow Mark Cuban's blog, skip this. It is mostly a summary of his blog posts.
  6. Finding the next Steve Jobs (Nolan Bushnell)
- Finding good talent and retaining it is probably the single most important thing you will do as startup founders (especially if you are the CEO). Many things in this book seem obvious (if you are familiar with the Silicon-valley culture). A good read before you set out to hire your dream team of "rockstars". A good companion book: "Outliers" By Malcom Gladwell.
  7. The hard thing about hard things (Ben Horowitz)
-Are you in a startup? If the answer is YES, then read this NOW. Ties well with "Finding the next Steve Jobs". I wish I had read this before I started my company. I have lost track of how many times I have listened to this audio-book.
  8. Start with the Why (Simon Sinek)
- Mid-late 2013 I came across Simon Sinek's ted talks on the golden-circle and my mind was blown. I bought the book the very next day and I keep coming back to my notes whenever we are starting a new project. Get the "Why?" right and the product will define itself. This is true for building companies as it is for building great products. A must read for every entrepreneur.
  9. Art of the Start (Guy Kawasaki)
-Getting ready to pitch? read this! Also watch Guy's many presentations/talks on YouTube. A good companion book- "Pitch Anything" By Oren Klaff
!Escaping Reality! 1. Hatching Twitter (Nick Bilton) -Sooooo much drama! Definitely learnt what not to do! Very interesting read.
  2. The accidental Billionaires (Ben Mezrcih)
-I have heard that not everything in this book is "completely-true" (more distorted than others...) but still a great read!
  3. The Martian (Andy Weir)
- Hands down the best science fiction book I have read. I have lost count how many times I have listened to the audio-book (probably >15). I want to go to MARS!
  4. Harry Potter Series.
-My go-to "background noise". I read the books as a kid. I use the audio-books to tune out the world when working on stuff that does not require my full attention (Listening Goblet of Fire as I type this)...
  5. Jurassic Park || The Lost world (Michael Crichton)
- Read the books as a kid. I usually listen to it while I am traveling. Still gets me as excited as it did when I first read the book. (The movies are nothing compared to the book...)
  6. Ender's Game (Orson Scott Card)
- I am looking forward to reading the entire series. Read it once, listened to it many times (lost count). I love Space!
  7. Ready Player One (Ernest Cline)
-I picked this book up while I was working on a VR project back in 2014. An excellent book for re-reads and a nice place to get some inspiration.
!Other honorable mentions:! Actionable Gamification (Yu-Kai Chou) I invented the Modern Age (Richard Snow) Inside the tornado (Geoffrey Moore) Jony Ive (Leander Kahney) Sprint (Jake Knapp) The lean startup (Eric Ries) The selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins) Titan (Ron Chernow) The inevitable (Kevin Kelly) The Innovators (Walter Isaacson) Scrum (Jeff Sutherland)
!Most if not all have an audio-book version!
If you are in a startup or plan to start one soon, reading/listening to books should become a routine. I try to get through at least one book a week, sometimes two.
Good luck!

How To Be A 3% Man by Corey Wayne [0]
I'm 30 now. I wish I had read this when I was 20. It would've made dating in my 20s so much easier. I came across it last year and it's probably the single most important book I'll ever read in my entire life, for the sole reason that understanding women will allow me to have a successful marriage one day. I cannot recommend this enough.

每一个夏天
从2012年夏天开始，每一个夏天总有美好的事情发生，昨天我重走5年前
走过的路，世纪钟下面的小猫爱小花，爱到复旦关门已经被擦去了，也不知道
小猫还爱着小花吗抑或还在一起吗，结婚了吗，组成幸福家庭了吗？池塘里面
取走的水现在还留在新疆，那个神奇美丽的地方，浩瀚的风景，燥热的夏天
小伙伴一直催我回到新疆取回那瓶水，那瓶水当初还被任勇喝了一口，也不知道
池塘里面的泉水味道怎么样，也不知道他还和当初的小姐姐怎么样。我在新疆
度过了人生中非常美好的四年，
6月的上海
老是下雨，5年前来的时候也在下雨，如今又在下雨，又一次在这个校园里面
迷路，树荫还是那么茂盛，想起四月份来一个很厉害的老师的实验室面试...
当年给读者杂志投的稿件似乎没人理会，也不知是那时的无病呻吟还是歇斯底里
让该杂志看不上，还是在那时整个社会开始被科技带的飞速发展，人性开始浮躁
看不上我那样的愣头青，没有黄段子，不会讲故事，不会熬鸡汤的文章吧。
早上翻到了大学好友的状态，竟然已穿越过塔克拉干沙漠，见过干枯的胡杨林
，也不知道这些胡杨林有没有像书中所说沉睡千年，却依然风华正茂。
新疆是浩瀚风景的故乡，我还在天山脚下游荡，便匆匆离开。后来常想，一个诗人
要是去过新疆得用处多么雄浑的诗篇，长河落日就可见一斑，即便有一日再
归去重游故地，还是少时风景吗?花有重开日，人无再少年的惆怅个日日夜夜浇筑
着关于新疆的美好和遗憾。

how to study
----------
Question everything.
Reading recent hidstory
Of science Of computers Of the cold war Of the second world war Of communism
Reading about what knowledge is and how do we reliably create it?
What is knowledge?
What are facts?
What is data?
Reading about areas outside your area, sociology
Social psychology
Also knowing only tools and no content will make you a technician at best. Knowing stuff about how the world works, what knowledge is and how we got here will make you a valuable colleague, leader, parent, friend.
Source: started liking school towards the end of high school, ended up another 6 years in universities.
Focus on finding out why you struggle with it and address those weaknesses

the brain has 2 modes.it contain focus mode and diffuse mode
about prostocation ,the teacher has a advice ,but i remmeneber
that when i am bechaor time.the pro psychology,when you start a
thing just 5 minuts ,you will adpted it .you mostly to do the things.
but  e experience i have not adapted.
about procrastinator.the tomato way is a way all mentioned bu all kinds of occassion.
in fact .the pro is main real reson.
out pro,the first 20 minutes is painful.but when ,if you can persir the  stage you  should
feel thet the pain will .the pro adivice that we use 25 minutes as a period to work.when you finish
the period ,yu can relax !!!
exercise is a good point or wat for your study
practise help convert temporary memeory to long-term memory
besides,about the peolple of lacking attention is may creative in many fields.

imposter syndrome is very common feeling.that is,you think that what u get is not worthy belonging to u
there are 2 views taht is ,test and homework is best methods that help you learning more!
but the method obey my method ,that is ,make things happen!
recall is a very important tool to build knowlege map ,just for example,when you reading a material,
you reorganize the material via recalling ,besides,about the tenique of simplify /anology is alwasys
mentioned such as feyman,if you can explain the knowledge to your grandfather well,you will be ok in understand
the material.there is a method mentioned,that is ,insert yourself to the problem !!!!but this is diffcult to understand   


about passion.passion is about things you are good at,but u should not follow your passion,many things need time
to be skiiled or say you are good at it,so you should broden it .well!
the teacher may recommen d abook,that is , a mind for numbers.!!!!
reading the complex material ,you may slown about it ,but it is  a reality,if u are quickliy,you will lose somethings.

array
------
use vector as array
struct Edge{
int nextnode;
int cost;
}
vector <Edge> edge[N];


0.c++ mode
using namespace std;

1.from now situation.i need to graps basic tree manipulate and graph manipulate.


from my sit:uation.fudan 's proramming test i need to grasp
1.how to get input
int a,scanf("%d",&a)---------how to get int
char b[50],scanf("%s",b),but you need to note that-------->how to get char
printf("%c",b[30]),printf("%s",b)

2.how to use  queue and stack and vector.
in these implemented algorithm ,you can use
a.you need to load the package(^---^ )
  #include <vector>
  #include <queue>
  #include <stack>
b.in finishing above steps,you can use them as int or char;
  stack <int> a/queue <int > b/vector <int>      
c.using the data struct .
  a.push(3)  queue.psuh(3)    heap.push(x)   how to add  data to vector  
  a.pop()    queue.pop()      heap.pop()
  a.top()    queue.front()    heap.top()
  a.empty()  queue.empty()    heap.empty()

3.how to use array ,it is a potional danger
struct node{
  int a;
  int b;
  void testfunction(int a, int b){
  printf("you have inputed %d\n",a+b)
  }
}yangming[63] .

it will create array it has 63 elements with struct


4. in fact ,you must note pointer when you use.
   pointer style is
    int *a
    char *a
    node *a
  when use in function ,you need to note that
  i will use a example,
  node * test(int a,int b){
   node A;
   A.a=3;
   A.b=4;
   A.testfunction(3,4)
   return &A
  }

  you need to know how to pass pointer to function
  int a,b;
  function(int &a,int &b)
       {
        *a=7;
        *b=8 ;
       }

  it may be string.

5.from the position ,i have no other worrys.
6.sort function , you need to using it.sort(a,b+c,compare)
7.you need to note pointer position.such as a[17].
a+5,it denotes sort ,sort 's parameter is cmp that return a bool.

8.about string ,you need to note that what is a clue of the ened of string?
  from now view,it is char[i]==0.you also note that
  the action about string such sa
 char a[35];
scanf("%s",a);
a='yang'
  strlen(a)==4?
  char b[35];
  strcopy(b,a)
  strcmp(a,b)

i also need to note that how to use include <string>


this situation is need to note
struct node{
  int a;
  int b;
  node * c
  node D?????///this is illegal?????


};

strcpy(s1,s2) s2 to s1
strcat(s1,s2) concatenates; s1+s2====python
strlen()
strcmp(s1,s2);s1==s2---0,s1>s2 ------->0,otherwise
strchr(s1,ch),find the ch char pointer ,it is ,a position;
strstr(s1,s2),return a pointer to the first occurence of string s2 in s1;


i may worry about link list implements.


string operate code
char b[30];
scanf("%s",b);
printf("you have input %s\n",b);
printf("you need to care about your input 's %d\n",strlen(b));
printf("i will test string end indication\n");
int i;
for(i=0;b[i]!=0;i++){
printf("length is ==%d\n",i);
continue;
}
printf("string length is %d\n,i bet b[i]==0,in fact is %c",i,b[i]);
char c[100];
strcpy(c,b);
printf("now c's value is %s\n",c);

11.priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int> >q;
   this is big heap implement
12.i need to master binary tree costruct  method.
  how to make a binary.
  first ,middle,rear iterate methd.from main view,i find that.data structure
  is
  struct node{
   int a;
   node *lchild;
  node *rchild;
  };   
 void preiterate()

iterate method is following:

struct Node{
Node *lchild;
Node *rchild;
char c;

} Tree[50];
int loc;//have allocate memory number;
//----------initiate node---------------
Node * create(){
Tree[loc].lichild==Tree[loc],rchild==Null;

return &Tree[loc++];
}



//------postorder--------------


void postorder(Node * T){
if (T->lchild!=Null){
postorder(T->lchild);

};
if (T->rchild!=Null){
postorder(T->rchild);


}
printf("%c",T->c);

}

other iterate methods.you need to steemulate ,but you need to
chnage print order;


-------
operate binary tree
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
struct Node{
Node *lchild;
Node *rchild;
int  c;

} Tree[50];

//----------initiate node---------------

i can feel that python interpreter actions when you run a script or a program ,a=3,allocate memory
??????????????????????????????????????????????a=Classexample(6,7,8).same ,allocate for the instance
,when you can use len(a)(the class implement __len()__ mwthod ),the interpreter see what a is ???
fuck it is a class (i doubt there it activate a mechinism that check  the type object,for instance,
the checked result is string ,it will understnd string class have implemented __len__ method,it will
invoke it,a.__len__() and the return value.) ,it will check if the class include a __len__() method,
if it  include,it will  get the value.if not,it will  give callback error or say it is exception!!!!

also observe reference count.another info a=[1,23,4,5],when i use a[3]=1,i only in-place (origin list position) change list rather than create a list,but also
spicial situation.you must notice.from my opinion,a=[1,2,3,4,5,6].you can understand that
list is common mutable consequnce,but string and tuple ,string is immutable,what is immutable,
immutable is a[3] if can change origin consequnce value. i can undestand ,when you a=a+b ,id(a) donot equal
origin id(a),but you use a+=[2],id(a) is oriign value.this is same in literaly.you can understand that in-place
as same position but new is not at same position.__iadd__ is the former ,by visrce.

I somehow cannot understand the trends, altough I checked following sites and utilized Twitter stats/trends.

* http://www.google.com/trends

* http://www.trendsresearch.com

* http://www.worldtrendsresearch.com/major-trends.php

Here is a general list of ideas that I'd like to pick 2 to 3 from the topics to create a project that is mashing them up in a Ruby On Rails project. It's important to choose only key features of each topic and merge them into one idea.

I don't see the problem that people seem to have according to trends, so I cannot solve it.

Can you please help me with that? I'm searching for a project idea.

server's function do deal with the data and return data
to customer,from send data view,i understand what style to
be used to send data ,it related to network ,i can go on  abstarct transmit data(via internet ,forward data to corresponding function),encript data,deal data,imho ,coreesonding network and algorithm,languge.of course ,i find that you must note there is data store problem.

via implement a __getitem__ and __len__ method,i can implent a sequence (or list )
most method,susch as len ,a[3],balabalbala......but i cannot change the sequece
's position  and value.imho,when you implement python __getitem__ method,when use len()
function,implecitly  invoke the __getitem__ method,other functions seem to be same!!!you must know python interpreter invoke this spicial methos,interpreter is
python version......i want to say that __repr__ and __str__ 's effect is same .but we advise you use __repr__method
imho,sequence is somthings such as animal include pepole
,monkey ,dog,pig,sequence include list.string etc

you can a=class(),a.classlevel to get value.you can refer to
https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/
.if you can in class to implement __getitem__ method,you will a[]
and result loop and reversed .so on,you can finish iterable  function such as
for
doctest the number of item s is a problem.

encode and decode
-------
about decode and encode ,the is connetction about convert byte to objetc that human can understand.
in unicode culture ,there is a way that convert charater,it is automatic unite of  a languge, to numbers
numbers converts to bit that was storaged in computer.from now my view,unicode define a large number to
corresponding alll kinds of charater.simple to say.unicode is like a table,you can map number to charater
in the world.about ascii,i want to say if i send you 65,you understand i send a A to you.from now,byte ,asingle
byte cannot slove to represent all kinds of symbol.i need to  understand python code how to convert machnie code.

load  balance

load balance represent make too many traffic to all kinds of
application server .(mr wang said).proxy server is a forwarding
request to different app server!!!
----
session and session id
-----
i understand session is paharase that  start client send request to server and server send
reply data to client between the two pharase.from my view,i think ,ssesion is to slove
the problem that how to slove http stateless  problem ,thatis,again http request ,you need to
write username and userpassword,but ssession id slove the problem,
a session id a connection.session is a data structure that
save your username and password(hassed).besides,you can save another things in
session,session connect mode is the following:user use username and
 password to login in web server if authenticated,server make a session
datastructure that includes your username and your password and allocate
a session id to the session and keep the session id in cookie and
send it to client allong with http/s response,when client go on another request,
it will send request to server with session id.
when server receive the session id .server will to check the session id if exsit
and do responding action .if exist ,go on .or server will request client
to login.  but there is another view,session a period that between user login in and
user login out.also session id and ssesion content is dictionary,eg,6374838834:{'username':yangming,
'password':xxxxxxxx(hashed)},about the form of session saved in server file system
or database or cache system.more things ,when more request were made ,you need
to send http request with session id in http body or head argments or cookie or usrl argument!!!
what i want to ask is the connection between cookie and http. another view,store too many data
in cilent-side will increse your traffic.i can use facebook  as example,when you first
login to server ,server check your passwod and username.if authenticated,fb will make
ssession id and  return your main page,and you continue request another link in your
page ,you donot need authenticate ,in the hood,the browser will use the -styile link
http://en.mail.qq.com/cgi-bin/readmail?sid=YkCUuyVilYYnMRxE,
2,en_US&rank=2&mailid=ZC3212-rI46SNYOKzg0RGk~5fHZO64&t=readsubmail&mode=fake&s=r2&base=12.07&pf=0&folderid=3&folderkey= ,you can  sid =.............
3e281772..but you need note that the session id is encrypted in cooike sent to server,but when you in chrome ,you can read uncrypted sseion id.....i want to know
when you click  a link in fb ,who make your url's sid ,who encrypt it?????more,when
clear your browser  data you will must  login again!!!!now i can undestand the connection between period and  ssession ,because after logining,your cookie will always
be invoked!!!!!!when you login out ,your sseion id can not be used!!!

----
nginx
-------
imho,nginx is a tool to increase web access to server to down memory and
cpu,it is similiar to apache.from some opnion .it is used to load banlance
such as ,forward all kinds of request to all kinds of app server and do more
opreation on  request,such as request size ,authen method .also another view ,
it is as a firewall ,for in a big rentepreter ,nginx act as fire wall to,for
oiur developer  cannot touch in system.

When you go with a thought,
you assume that the thought is true,
and you can take a series of logical steps.
 Just like this: If A is true,
 that means B is true. And if B is true, that means C is true. And if C is true,

Secret #6: Redirect Your Attention
When you run out of things to say, you can use “focus changer”. Focus changer is a question you ask yourself on paper that requires you to comment on something you’ve just written. It keeps you moving, and helps you focus on the yet unexplored parts of a situation.

Examples of focus changers include:

What was I thinking here?
How else can I say that?

Prompt Your Thinking
Prompts are Freewriting exercise. When doing this exercise, you begin the Freewriting session with a pre-determined prompt.

Prompts are open-ended phrases to warm you up and to send your mind into unanticipated directions.

Prompts allow you to find many hidden jewels that you wouldn’t otherwise discover.

Some examples of prompts include:

The best part of my workday is…
Yesterday I saw a curious thing…
If I didn’t have to work, I’d…
I threw a stone and it landed…
I remember….
I’d love to learn about…
If I did the opposite of everything I normally do, my day would look like this…
I love…
I hate…
I should do more…
You know what I’d like to do again?
If I were guaranteed success, the project I’d take on would be…
The very generic ones can work wonders:

The storm
It was getting dark…
The birds were singing…
I opened the door…
Three days from now…
Prompts are somewhat similar to one of my long-time favorite techniques – question answered on paper. Basically, you write a question, and then start answering it. That’s it. It’s like querying your mind.

When you make the question very open-ended, you are not looking for specific answers, and it’s a prompt. The result will be a surprise. On the other hand, when the question is very specific, so will be the answers.

4.make a anonoly  is good
5.do different things is good
6.communicate with  a  somethings

imho,python is simpile ,python use list ,dictionary,set
as basic datatype ,in other worlds ,i just am familiar with these,
i understand python decorator is a packager that package gift
but gift does not chnage .origin function allso all ulity
,but origin function need to have have return value ,the return
value will be used to make somthings.for example ,i write a decorater
function to print decorated function got arguments.i think that
youtube and twitter or internet have good resource to help
you become more great pythoner .python also have a view,that is,
your code is pythonic..........from where i stand,i find that if you
can not make use of anonoly to compare .after this time,you will forgrt
what you have understand........

python interpreter run  a .py file located in disk and ask os to allocate space in
memory to run the program.before compiling,there is a paser ,it will parser grammar
to syntax tree,comiple the tree to bytecode.there  are more discuss,in compile,that is
,.py------>.pyc that is,in fact,import sector will convert to .pyc .for example.a.by
include import b(b.py),that is ,b.py-------b.pyc.but a will not compile.but in the runtime a.py will be compile to .pyc in memory.........but when you exit ,it will
delete .pyc file..

python
------
form now,i feel that python all kinds of methods implemented by class method
aalso,class method main include magical method,this is main method to implement
such as len(), d[k],in so on .yeah .of course,i doubt that string ,list ,dict is
some subclass ,just  a guess ,such as ,collection,object .......balbala.about class method ,there is a mechinism called fall back to ,it is, when you invoke a method ,the method doesnot exist ,it will invoke another method.

algorithm
--------
i understand algorithm is about :sort ,search,heap,queqe,stack,link list,graph,my view is form
yanweimin,i can remember sort is very importtant ,sort algorithm has so many types:bubble sort,
bucket sort,heap sort ,iterate sort,or so on, i canot remember ,bubble sort 's principle is very simple,in ervery iteration,you need  to make the corresponding element to correct position.if there is 1,3,4,2,5'
for 5>2,you left position ,for 2<4,2 will be in 4  origin postion ,for 2<3,2 will  be in 3's position ,for
2>1, i will go 1,i 's left position has no number .first sort is ok!!!!!iin algorithm ,i dislike complixity
analysis.for i feel that i cannot grasp math and logic in these algorithm.i believe 5,4,3,2,1 is the
shit  case of bubble sort.this is o(n*n)! i remember there is another and usual sort algorithm............

0.get url moudle url from  smip.py
1.get devicelist [] according to allivpdevice() or to  parser r.get('dbinfo')
  example ['ivp1','ivp2','ivp3','ivp4']
2.generate url that will be requested by  grequest
  [url1,url2,url3,url4,url5,url6,url7,url8,url9,url10] accroding to ivp device
  ,every part respond to a device in order to set corresponding redis

3.use grequest to requests these urls list-style
  [ivp1,ivp2]-------device list
  [requirement1,requirement2]------------requirement list
  [url,url2,url3,url4]------url list
  [response1,response2,response3,response4]



4.when get the response list ,this is a very difficult part !!!!
  a. write a loop to parser response and r.set every ivp corresponding info
     eg.if every 5 response belong to a device ,u should write:
     for device in alldevice:
     !.there,i need to get the id (that is,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
      r.set('device+req',response[id] )
     this is a math problem  :
      0×2+（0，1）
      1×2+（0，1）

5.change the all origin requests and use  r.get('device+requirements')
  replace requests.get() with r.get('xxxxx)


6.place all smip device in grequests.py to test

--------------
python  directory pythonpath
-----------
You need to add your new directory to the environment variable PYTHONPATH, separated by a colon from previous contents thereof. In any form of Unix, you can do that in a startup script appropriate to whatever shell you're using (.profile or whatever, depending on your favorite shell) with a command which, again, depends on the shell in question; in Windows, you can do it through the system GUI for the purpose.

superuser.com may be a better place to ask further, i.e. for more details if you need specifics about how to enrich an environment variable in your chosen platform and shell, since it's not really a programming question per se.

    ...:         c=self.b
    ...:         print c
    ...:         print(a+b)

a,b is class level variable,use and modify them,you should use self to point the function
and the a ,b in __init__ function and test function is function  argument,use them
u only need to use a ,b .derived from a  class ,u can rewrite a method use same function
name!!!!

class a:
    def __init__(self,a,b):
        self.a=a
        print(self.a)

There are some books I keep coming back to when I am "feeling lost and/or hopeless", when my "back is up against the wall and/or feel cornered", when I feel like I have "hit rock bottom" or I just need to "escape reality"... This list contains books I have read/listened to more than a couple times:
!For inspiration:! 1. Loosing my virginity (Richard Branson) - Richard Branson's Autobiography. From student magazine to Virgin to crazy ballooning adventures and space! I keep coming back to this when I feel like I need a morale boost. There isn't an audible version for this book, but there is a summary-type version on Audible "Screw it, Let's do it"- does a good job curating the exciting parts.
  2. The Everything Store (Brad Stone)
-AMAZON and the man leading the massive team behind it. Jeff Bezos is quite easily one of the most important and influential people in the world. His relentless pursuit to build Amazon (& it's various products) amid constant setbacks, losses and naysayers... I personally use Amazon and their products every day. It's a really interesting view of how things are run backstage.
  3. Steve Jobs (Walter Isaacson)
- One of the most popular books in the Valley. Almost all startup founders I have met has read this. They usually have a very polarized view of Jobs after reading this. Take the good stuff and leave out the bad/crazy. Jobs was a very polarizing person and so is his biography...This is a very long book. "The second Coming of Steve Jobs" by Alan Deutschman is another really good book and a much shorter read and not super-polarizing (leaves out some of the crazy stuff from early life). Other notable Steve Jobs books I have read & highly recommend: Becoming Steve Jobs & The Steve Jobs Way.
  4. Elon Musk (Ashlee Vance)
-Another polarizing book. I am a Spacex & Tesla Fan-boy. I picked this up in 2015 the day it was launched! I have read this at least half a dozen times by now. Hard-work, perseverance and creativity to the max. A must read for every entrepreneur.
  5. iWoz (Steve Wozniak)
-If you are a technical-founder, this is a must read! Gives a very interesting view of- behind the scenes at Apple during its inception and early years. I was really moved by how humble Woz was/is and I am inspired by his problem solving approach.
  6. How Google Works (Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle & Jonathan Rosenberg)
- A very good book to read after/before this: "In the Plex" by Steven Levy. Hands down the two most important / influential books while you are starting something new. I read these while I was contemplating conceiving my startup and giving up the "safety" (illusion of safety) of a "normal-job". A must read for anyone planing to start a company and want to take it to the stratosphere (or higher)!
  7. Dreams from My Father (Barack Obama)
- Another polarizing personality. A short but powerful memoir by Obama. This gives a unique insight into Obama's thought processes. Most people can relate to this and every "Leader" must read this. It really helps clear some of the fog on- what makes an effective leader.
!Business & Management:!
  1. The Upstarts (Brad Stone)
-An amazing story about AirBnB and Uber. Culture is key and culture is defined by the Founders and the first few hires. The two companies are extremely similar in many ways (timing, shared economy, disruptive) but radically different in the way they are run. This came out earlier this year and is probably one of the best "startup-books" of 2017!
  2. Zero to One (Peter Thiel)
-A very short book, a must read for every entrepreneur. Dives into "first principal" thinking & execution. A very good read after/before "Elon Musk" the biography by Ashlee Vance.
  3. The power of Habit (Charles Duhigg)
-I have always wondered how successful people get so much done. They have the same amount of time as everyone else, but they are able to get so much more done...how? This book answered that question. Ever since, I have been using "Habits" as my ultimate personal tool. Day & night difference when you figure out how habits are formed how they are broken and how you can influence the process. A good companion book (from the same author) "Smarter Faster Better".
  4. How to win friends & Influence people (Dale Carnegi)
- I bought this book freshman year in college. I tried reading it then and gave up / got bored after the first few pages. I really wish I had actually made an effort to read the whole thing. It sat on my shelf collecting dust. Luckily I picked up the book again and gave it another shot. I read this during a particularly "rough-patch" at our startup- really helped me cope with the "situation". What was once a boring book is now scribbled with notes, bookmarks and highlights. A very useful life-guide.
  5. How to win at the Sport of Business (Mark Cuban)
- A very entertaining yet eye-opening book. It is very short, finished it in a couple hours. A must read for every entrepreneur. I keep coming back to this when I feel like things are going dreadfully slow and I need a boost. If you follow Mark Cuban's blog, skip this. It is mostly a summary of his blog posts.
  6. Finding the next Steve Jobs (Nolan Bushnell)
- Finding good talent and retaining it is probably the single most important thing you will do as startup founders (especially if you are the CEO). Many things in this book seem obvious (if you are familiar with the Silicon-valley culture). A good read before you set out to hire your dream team of "rockstars". A good companion book: "Outliers" By Malcom Gladwell.
  7. The hard thing about hard things (Ben Horowitz)
-Are you in a startup? If the answer is YES, then read this NOW. Ties well with "Finding the next Steve Jobs". I wish I had read this before I started my company. I have lost track of how many times I have listened to this audio-book.
  8. Start with the Why (Simon Sinek)
- Mid-late 2013 I came across Simon Sinek's ted talks on the golden-circle and my mind was blown. I bought the book the very next day and I keep coming back to my notes whenever we are starting a new project. Get the "Why?" right and the product will define itself. This is true for building companies as it is for building great products. A must read for every entrepreneur.
  9. Art of the Start (Guy Kawasaki)
-Getting ready to pitch? read this! Also watch Guy's many presentations/talks on YouTube. A good companion book- "Pitch Anything" By Oren Klaff
!Escaping Reality! 1. Hatching Twitter (Nick Bilton) -Sooooo much drama! Definitely learnt what not to do! Very interesting read.
  2. The accidental Billionaires (Ben Mezrcih)
-I have heard that not everything in this book is "completely-true" (more distorted than others...) but still a great read!
  3. The Martian (Andy Weir)
- Hands down the best science fiction book I have read. I have lost count how many times I have listened to the audio-book (probably >15). I want to go to MARS!
  4. Harry Potter Series.
-My go-to "background noise". I read the books as a kid. I use the audio-books to tune out the world when working on stuff that does not require my full attention (Listening Goblet of Fire as I type this)...
  5. Jurassic Park || The Lost world (Michael Crichton)
- Read the books as a kid. I usually listen to it while I am traveling. Still gets me as excited as it did when I first read the book. (The movies are nothing compared to the book...)
  6. Ender's Game (Orson Scott Card)
- I am looking forward to reading the entire series. Read it once, listened to it many times (lost count). I love Space!
  7. Ready Player One (Ernest Cline)
-I picked this book up while I was working on a VR project back in 2014. An excellent book for re-reads and a nice place to get some inspiration.
!Other honorable mentions:! Actionable Gamification (Yu-Kai Chou) I invented the Modern Age (Richard Snow) Inside the tornado (Geoffrey Moore) Jony Ive (Leander Kahney) Sprint (Jake Knapp) The lean startup (Eric Ries) The selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins) Titan (Ron Chernow) The inevitable (Kevin Kelly) The Innovators (Walter Isaacson) Scrum (Jeff Sutherland)
!Most if not all have an audio-book version!
If you are in a startup or plan to start one soon, reading/listening to books should become a routine. I try to get through at least one book a week, sometimes two.
Good luck!

How To Be A 3% Man by Corey Wayne [0]
I'm 30 now. I wish I had read this when I was 20. It would've made dating in my 20s so much easier. I came across it last year and it's probably the single most important book I'll ever read in my entire life, for the sole reason that understanding women will allow me to have a successful marriage one day. I cannot recommend this enough.

每一个夏天
从2012年夏天开始，每一个夏天总有美好的事情发生，昨天我重走5年前
走过的路，世纪钟下面的小猫爱小花，爱到复旦关门已经被擦去了，也不知道
小猫还爱着小花吗抑或还在一起吗，结婚了吗，组成幸福家庭了吗？池塘里面
取走的水现在还留在新疆，那个神奇美丽的地方，浩瀚的风景，燥热的夏天
小伙伴一直催我回到新疆取回那瓶水，那瓶水当初还被任勇喝了一口，也不知道
池塘里面的泉水味道怎么样，也不知道他还和当初的小姐姐怎么样。我在新疆
度过了人生中非常美好的四年，
6月的上海
老是下雨，5年前来的时候也在下雨，如今又在下雨，又一次在这个校园里面
迷路，树荫还是那么茂盛，想起四月份来一个很厉害的老师的实验室面试...
当年给读者杂志投的稿件似乎没人理会，也不知是那时的无病呻吟还是歇斯底里
让该杂志看不上，还是在那时整个社会开始被科技带的飞速发展，人性开始浮躁
看不上我那样的愣头青，没有黄段子，不会讲故事，不会熬鸡汤的文章吧。
早上翻到了大学好友的状态，竟然已穿越过塔克拉干沙漠，见过干枯的胡杨林
，也不知道这些胡杨林有没有像书中所说沉睡千年，却依然风华正茂。
新疆是浩瀚风景的故乡，我还在天山脚下游荡，便匆匆离开。后来常想，一个诗人
要是去过新疆得用处多么雄浑的诗篇，长河落日就可见一斑，即便有一日再
归去重游故地，还是少时风景吗?花有重开日，人无再少年的惆怅个日日夜夜浇筑
着关于新疆的美好和遗憾。

how to study
----------
Question everything.
Reading recent hidstory
Of science Of computers Of the cold war Of the second world war Of communism
Reading about what knowledge is and how do we reliably create it?
What is knowledge?
What are facts?
What is data?
Reading about areas outside your area, sociology
Social psychology
Also knowing only tools and no content will make you a technician at best. Knowing stuff about how the world works, what knowledge is and how we got here will make you a valuable colleague, leader, parent, friend.
Source: started liking school towards the end of high school, ended up another 6 years in universities.
Focus on finding out why you struggle with it and address those weaknesses

the brain has 2 modes.it contain focus mode and diffuse mode
about prostocation ,the teacher has a advice ,but i remmeneber
that when i am bechaor time.the pro psychology,when you start a
thing just 5 minuts ,you will adpted it .you mostly to do the things.
but  e experience i have not adapted.
about procrastinator.the tomato way is a way all mentioned bu all kinds of occassion.
in fact .the pro is main real reson.
out pro,the first 20 minutes is painful.but when ,if you can persir the  stage you  should
feel thet the pain will .the pro adivice that we use 25 minutes as a period to work.when you finish
the period ,yu can relax !!!
exercise is a good point or wat for your study
practise help convert temporary memeory to long-term memory
besides,about the peolple of lacking attention is may creative in many fields.

imposter syndrome is very common feeling.that is,you think that what u get is not worthy belonging to u
there are 2 views taht is ,test and homework is best methods that help you learning more!
but the method obey my method ,that is ,make things happen!
recall is a very important tool to build knowlege map ,just for example,when you reading a material,
you reorganize the material via recalling ,besides,about the tenique of simplify /anology is alwasys
mentioned such as feyman,if you can explain the knowledge to your grandfather well,you will be ok in understand
the material.there is a method mentioned,that is ,insert yourself to the problem !!!!but this is diffcult to understand   


about passion.passion is about things you are good at,but u should not follow your passion,many things need time
to be skiiled or say you are good at it,so you should broden it .well!
the teacher may recommen d abook,that is , a mind for numbers.!!!!
reading the complex material ,you may slown about it ,but it is  a reality,if u are quickliy,you will lose somethings.

blockchain deomo
-------
https://anders.com/blockchain/


-------
blockchain 
----------
blockchain is legder system.when someone send money to someone ,the 
transaction is  represented as a block,the block is broadcasted to 
the network all parcipants(in fact  a pc) and all members(that is ,miners) use the protocal(all members agress ,that is ,census ) a and appove the block.(memebers use the public key released by the sender  and check the signature is released by the private key of sender  and verify the coins if exisits)after the course 
the block was add the blockchain(that is legder system ),the transaction finished.
slove the double spendinf.the problem is that when a send money to b .the transaction is send to all memebers ,allmemebers use a's public key to verify 
the transaction is a ,when a receivve money,a send the info to all or part meembers to verify ,to affirm the balance is  ok.if ok,the ok will be  as a signal
to decide if a receive.
IN FACT ,this is ,a series of reaction if u change a block


blcokchain function ,that is ,the function is so
hashvalue=f(f(f(a0,b0,c0),a1,b1,c1),a2,b2,c2)
if u change any a or b ,the result will be different with the origin 
every function  has a value ,i understand that it is a hash.so the function 
was distribute to every one ,i will check every function result from  the last 
to the begin ,i will know which  arguments was modified(other blockchain) 


the coinbase will send money to someone ,the someone as start point
,of course i cannot understand that many people as memeber take part in
the activities!!!


--------
blockchain
-----------
there is a note used to record all transaction,such as,wang owes
5 yuan to yang,li owes 3 yuan to xi ,so that ,for the pki(public key crypt instructual),every transaction is realiable.(Bob can use Alice's public key to authenticate signed transaction by decrypting the ciphertext.
Only Alice knows her private key, hence Alice can't deny that the transaction took place - she signed it.
Neither Bob nor anyone else can fake or modify a transaction without access to Alice's private key.)

use crypt to develop the cost than the profit by attack the function,double
-spending such as one restate home was selled to many people
i feel that when u finish a transaction ,the transaction was send to all memebers
so that all memeber updated the legeder .there is no problem.so that .the finance 
situation and balance is clear for clear



to slove the problem of double spending ,the blockchain suplythe census 
method.that is devide into two ways,all people agree and updated the respective
legder ,another ,the designed percent of people agree ,we think the transaction is ok

  a.pop()    queue.pop()      heap.pop()
  a.top()    queue.front()    heap.top()
  a.empty()  queue.empty()    heap.empty()

3.how to use array ,it is a potional danger
struct node{
  int a;
  int b;
  void testfunction(int a, int b){
  printf("you have inputed %d\n",a+b)
  }
}yangming[63] .

it will create array it has 63 elements with struct


4. in fact ,you must note pointer when you use.
   pointer style is
    int *a
    char *a
    node *a
  when use in function ,you need to note that
  i will use a example,
  node * test(int a,int b){
   node A;
   A.a=3;
   A.b=4;
   A.testfunction(3,4)
   return &A
  }

  you need to know how to pass pointer to function
  int a,b;
  function(int &a,int &b)
       {
        *a=7;
        *b=8 ;
       }

  it may be string.

5.from the position ,i have no other worrys.
6.sort function , you need to using it.sort(a,b+c,compare)
7.you need to note pointer position.such as a[17].
a+5,it denotes sort ,sort 's parameter is cmp that return a bool.

8.about string ,you need to note that what is a clue of the ened of string?
  from now view,it is char[i]==0.you also note that
  the action about string such sa
 char a[35];
scanf("%s",a);
a='yang'
  strlen(a)==4?
  char b[35];
  strcopy(b,a)
  strcmp(a,b)

i also need to note that how to use include <string>


this situation is need to note
struct node{
  int a;
  int b;
  node * c
  node D?????///this is illegal?????


};

strcpy(s1,s2) s2 to s1
strcat(s1,s2) concatenates; s1+s2====python
strlen()
strcmp(s1,s2);s1==s2---0,s1>s2 ------->0,otherwise
strchr(s1,ch),find the ch char pointer ,it is ,a position;
strstr(s1,s2),return a pointer to the first occurence of string s2 in s1;


i may worry about link list implements.


string operate code
char b[30];
scanf("%s",b);
printf("you have input %s\n",b);
printf("you need to care about your input 's %d\n",strlen(b));
printf("i will test string end indication\n");
int i;
for(i=0;b[i]!=0;i++){
printf("length is ==%d\n",i);
continue;
}
printf("string length is %d\n,i bet b[i]==0,in fact is %c",i,b[i]);
char c[100];
strcpy(c,b);
printf("now c's value is %s\n",c);

11.priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int> >q;
   this is big heap implement
12.i need to master binary tree costruct  method.
  how to make a binary.
  first ,middle,rear iterate methd.from main view,i find that.data structure
  is
  struct node{
   int a;
   node *lchild;
  node *rchild;
  };   
 void preiterate()

iterate method is following:

struct Node{
Node *lchild;
Node *rchild;
char c;

} Tree[50];
int loc;//have allocate memory number;
//----------initiate node---------------
Node * create(){
Tree[loc].lichild==Tree[loc],rchild==Null;

return &Tree[loc++];
}



//------postorder--------------


void postorder(Node * T){
if (T->lchild!=Null){
postorder(T->lchild);

};
if (T->rchild!=Null){
postorder(T->rchild);


}
printf("%c",T->c);

}

other iterate methods.you need to steemulate ,but you need to
chnage print order;


-------
operate binary tree
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
struct Node{
Node *lchild;
Node *rchild;
int  c;

} Tree[50];
int loc;//have allocate memory number;
//----------initiate node---------------
Node * create(){
Tree[loc].lchild=Tree[loc].rchild=NULL;
Node * nodeposition;
nodeposition= &Tree[loc];
loc=loc+1;
return nodeposition;
}

char str1[30],str2[30];

//------postorder--------------
void postorder(Node * T){
if (T->lchild!=NULL){
postorder(T->lchild);

};
if (T->rchild!=NULL){
postorder(T->rchild);


}
printf("%d",T->c);

}

void midorder(Node* T){
if(T->lchild!=NULL) midorder(T->lchild);
printf("%d",T->c);
if(T->rchild!=NULL) midorder(T->rchild);
}



/**

break;

}}

**/


Node* insert(Node *T,int x){
if (T==NULL){
T=create();
T->c=x;
return T;
}
else if (x<T->c)
 T->lchild=insert(T->lchild,x);
else if (x>T->c)
  T->rchild=insert(T->rchild,x);
return T;

}

int main(){

int n;
while (scanf("%d",&n)!=EOF){
loc=0;
Node *T=NULL;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
int x;
scanf("%d",&x);
T=insert(T,x);



}
printf("post order is \n");
postorder(T);
printf("mid order is \n");

return 0;

i can feel that python interpreter actions when you run a script or a program ,a=3,allocate memory
??????????????????????????????????????????????a=Classexample(6,7,8).same ,allocate for the instance
,when you can use len(a)(the class implement __len()__ mwthod ),the interpreter see what a is ???
fuck it is a class (i doubt there it activate a mechinism that check  the type object,for instance,
the checked result is string ,it will understnd string class have implemented __len__ method,it will
invoke it,a.__len__() and the return value.) ,it will check if the class include a __len__() method,
if it  include,it will  get the value.if not,it will  give callback error or say it is exception!!!!

i doubt all python object implemented by class
phd sai that python object in python shell(or interpreter ) life circle
is exit python shell.but in function ,wehn function end,the object end ,but
also observe reference count.another info a=[1,23,4,5],when i use a[3]=1,i only in-place (origin list position) change list rather than create a list,but also
spicial situation.you must notice.from my opinion,a=[1,2,3,4,5,6].you can understand that
list is common mutable consequnce,but string and tuple ,string is immutable,what is immutable,
immutable is a[3] if can change origin consequnce value. i can undestand ,when you a=a+b ,id(a) donot equal
origin id(a),but you use a+=[2],id(a) is oriign value.this is same in literaly.you can understand that in-place
as same position but new is not at same position.__iadd__ is the former ,by visrce.

* http://www.worldtrendsresearch.com/major-trends.php

Here is a general list of ideas that I'd like to pick 2 to 3 from the topics to create a project that is mashing them up in a Ruby On Rails project. It's important to choose only key features of each topic and merge them into one idea.

I don't see the problem that people seem to have according to trends, so I cannot solve it.

Can you please help me with that? I'm searching for a project idea.

when you use html form,you can use from element to  implement the function

what i understand the internet is the c/s ,sustomer
send data to server ,server detect data if need be deal with,such as user if login,if data written to database,
server's function do deal with the data and return data
to customer,from send data view,i understand what style to
be used to send data ,it related to network ,i can go on  abstarct transmit data(via internet ,forward data to corresponding function),encript data,deal data,imho ,coreesonding network and algorithm,languge.of course ,i find that you must note there is data store problem.

via implement a __getitem__ and __len__ method,i can implent a sequence (or list )
most method,susch as len ,a[3],balabalbala......but i cannot change the sequece
's position  and value.imho,when you implement python __getitem__ method,when use len()
function,implecitly  invoke the __getitem__ method,other functions seem to be same!!!you must know python interpreter invoke this spicial methos,interpreter is
python version......i want to say that __repr__ and __str__ 's effect is same .but we advise you use __repr__method
imho,sequence is somthings such as animal include pepole
,monkey ,dog,pig,sequence include list.string etc

python
-----
python class attribute have two type
that include 1. in  __init__ 2.in class level,but i have doubt that in class level i
 can via self.classlevelattrubute to modeify . i affirm to access is good
you can a=class(),a.classlevel to get value.you can refer to
https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/
.if you can in class to implement __getitem__ method,you will a[]
and result loop and reversed .so on,you can finish iterable  function such as
for
doctest the number of item s is a problem.

encode and decode
-------
about decode and encode ,the is connetction about convert byte to objetc that human can understand.
in unicode culture ,there is a way that convert charater,it is automatic unite of  a languge, to numbers
numbers converts to bit that was storaged in computer.from now my view,unicode define a large number to
corresponding alll kinds of charater.simple to say.unicode is like a table,you can map number to charater
in the world.about ascii,i want to say if i send you 65,you understand i send a A to you.from now,byte ,asingle
byte cannot slove to represent all kinds of symbol.i need to  understand python code how to convert machnie code.


--------
load  balance
---------
load balance represent make too many traffic to all kinds of
application server .(mr wang said).proxy server is a forwarding
request to different app server!!!
----
session and session id
-----
i understand session is paharase that  start client send request to server and server send
reply data to client between the two pharase.from my view,i think ,ssesion is to slove
the problem that how to slove http stateless  problem ,thatis,again http request ,you need to
write username and userpassword,but ssession id slove the problem,
a session id a connection.session is a data structure that
save your username and password(hassed).besides,you can save another things in
session,session connect mode is the following:user use username and
 password to login in web server if authenticated,server make a session
datastructure that includes your username and your password and allocate
a session id to the session and keep the session id in cookie and
send it to client allong with http/s response,when client go on another request,
it will send request to server with session id.
when server receive the session id .server will to check the session id if exsit
and do responding action .if exist ,go on .or server will request client
to login.  but there is another view,session a period that between user login in and
user login out.also session id and ssesion content is dictionary,eg,6374838834:{'username':yangming,
'password':xxxxxxxx(hashed)},about the form of session saved in server file system
or database or cache system.more things ,when more request were made ,you need
to send http request with session id in http body or head argments or cookie or usrl argument!!!
what i want to ask is the connection between cookie and http. another view,store too many data
in cilent-side will increse your traffic.i can use facebook  as example,when you first
login to server ,server check your passwod and username.if authenticated,fb will make
ssession id and  return your main page,and you continue request another link in your
page ,you donot need authenticate ,in the hood,the browser will use the -styile link
http://en.mail.qq.com/cgi-bin/readmail?sid=YkCUuyVilYYnMRxE,
2,en_US&rank=2&mailid=ZC3212-rI46SNYOKzg0RGk~5fHZO64&t=readsubmail&mode=fake&s=r2&base=12.07&pf=0&folderid=3&folderkey= ,you can  sid =.............
3e281772..but you need note that the session id is encrypted in cooike sent to server,but when you in chrome ,you can read uncrypted sseion id.....i want to know
when you click  a link in fb ,who make your url's sid ,who encrypt it?????more,when
clear your browser  data you will must  login again!!!!now i can undestand the connection between period and  ssession ,because after logining,your cookie will always
be invoked!!!!!!when you login out ,your sseion id can not be used!!!

imho,nginx is a tool to increase web access to server to down memory and

opreation on  request,such as request size ,authen method .also another view ,
it is as a firewall ,for in a big rentepreter ,nginx act as fire wall to,for

```
#  client and server model
```
 ## net work  by yangming

 flask can slove all kinds of problem s
 i can abstract web develop is fellowing:
 client send  infomation to server ,server get the request
 and deal with the request ,as usaual ,it get a url .it will
 depath a url  to scratch to get all kinds of arguments.for example
 the url is http://wwww.goo.com/?queryyangming=234&ui=colorful
 .the server will get yangming and ui .after this,this argumewnts will be pass to corresponding function to deal with and get return value .
 after it,server return value send to client,and client do corresponding actions.imho,json in this course was used frequently
 as info media at http body !!!!

you assume that the thought is true,
and you can take a series of logical steps.
 Just like this: If A is true,
 that means B is true. And if B is true, that means C is true. And if C is true,

why markdown does not work in web page paster

Secret #6: Redirect Your Attention
When you run out of things to say, you can use “focus changer”. Focus changer is a question you ask yourself on paper that requires you to comment on something you’ve just written. It keeps you moving, and helps you focus on the yet unexplored parts of a situation.

Examples of focus changers include:

What was I thinking here?
How else can I say that?

Prompt Your Thinking
Prompts are Freewriting exercise. When doing this exercise, you begin the Freewriting session with a pre-determined prompt.

Prompts are open-ended phrases to warm you up and to send your mind into unanticipated directions.

Prompts allow you to find many hidden jewels that you wouldn’t otherwise discover.

Some examples of prompts include:

The best part of my workday is…
Yesterday I saw a curious thing…
If I didn’t have to work, I’d…
I threw a stone and it landed…
I remember….
I’d love to learn about…
If I did the opposite of everything I normally do, my day would look like this…
I love…
I hate…
I should do more…
You know what I’d like to do again?
If I were guaranteed success, the project I’d take on would be…
The very generic ones can work wonders:

The storm
It was getting dark…
The birds were singing…
I opened the door…
Three days from now…
Prompts are somewhat similar to one of my long-time favorite techniques – question answered on paper. Basically, you write a question, and then start answering it. That’s it. It’s like querying your mind.

When you make the question very open-ended, you are not looking for specific answers, and it’s a prompt. The result will be a surprise. On the other hand, when the question is very specific, so will be the answers.
